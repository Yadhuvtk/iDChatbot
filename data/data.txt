what is the spec for screenprint?
Positive: 1 pt, Negative: 1.5–2 pt, Text: ~9 pt sans-serif. Prevents ink spread issues.

What format should artwork be provided in when redrawing?
All redrawn artwork must be supplied strictly as vector art. Vector artwork is resolution-independent and can be scaled without quality loss. Raster images can cause blurry edges, inaccurate line weights, and production failures.

What are the preferred file formats for vector artwork?
The approved formats are AI (Adobe Illustrator), EPS, and vector-based PDF. PDFs containing embedded raster images are not acceptable.

How should fonts be handled in vector artwork?
All fonts must be converted to outlines or paths before submission.

Why must fonts be outlined before production?
Vendors may not have the same fonts installed. Outlining prevents font substitution and layout issues and ensures the artwork prints exactly as approved.

What color system should be used for imprinting artwork?
Pantone Solid Coated (C) colors must be used for all imprint methods.

Why should RGB and CMYK be avoided for screen and pad printing?
RGB and CMYK are device-dependent systems. Screen and pad printing rely on mixed inks, which can cause color shifts if RGB or CMYK is used.

When is CMYK acceptable?
Only for full-color digital printing or heat transfer.

Why are minimum line weights critical in screen printing?
Ink spreads during printing, and thin lines may fill in or disappear.

What are the minimum specs for notebook screen printing, and why?
Positive: 1 pt, Negative: 1.5–2 pt, Text: ~9 pt sans-serif. This prevents ink spread issues.

What are the minimum specs for apparel and tote screen printing?
Positive: 1.5 pt, Negative: 2–3 pt, Text: 14 pt sans-serif.

Why are gradients generally not allowed in screen printing?
Gradients often appear banded or muddy. Only halftones are acceptable.

What are halftones and why are 35–45 LPI recommended?
Halftones simulate gradients using dots. 35–45 LPI balances detail and print stability.

Why does pad printing require special design considerations?
Pad printing involves curved surfaces where small details can distort.

What are the minimum specs for pad printing and why?
Positive: 1 pt, Negative: 1.5 pt, Text: 8–10 pt for clean transfer.

Why should tight color registration be avoided in pad printing?
Pad movement can cause misalignment between colors.

What is color trapping and why is it important?
Trapping overlaps colors slightly to prevent gaps caused by misregistration.

Why does embroidery require extreme simplification?
Artwork is converted into stitches, and fine details cannot be reproduced accurately.

What are the minimum embroidery specs and their purpose?
Letter height: 24 pt, Gap: 2.5 pt to maintain stitch clarity.

Why are sans-serif or block fonts recommended for embroidery?
Uniform strokes translate better into thread.

How are small symbols like ® handled in embroidery?
They are simplified or removed to maintain clarity.

Why should laser engraving avoid ultra-thin lines?
Thin lines engrave inconsistently and may appear as scratches.

What are the recommended minimum specs for laser engraving?
Positive: 0.5–1 pt, Negative: 0.5 pt, Text: 6 pt.

Why does debossing require thicker artwork?
Pressure can collapse thin lines.

What are the minimum specs for debossing and embossing?
Positive: 1–2 pt, Negative: 2 pt, Text: 12 pt.

Why do internal counters often fill in during debossing?
Soft materials compress and close small internal spaces.

Why is heat transfer ideal for complex artwork?
It supports fine details, gradients, and full color.

What are the minimum specs for heat transfer artwork?
Positive: 0.5 pt, Negative: 0.75 pt.

Why do small floating elements need special treatment?
They may peel or lift. Adding outlines or bleed improves durability.

Why must artwork respect physical production limits?
Ignoring limits causes print failures and rework.

What font adjustments are typically required during redraws?
Thicker strokes, simplification, or font replacement.

How should colors be handled during redraws?
Pantone colors must be assigned intentionally.

Why is simplification essential for embroidery and embossing?
Simplification ensures durability, readability, and clean production.
